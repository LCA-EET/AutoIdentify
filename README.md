This mod, for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition games, sets the Lore value of all items to zero. Items with a Lore value of zero are automatically identified, obviating the need for the player to manually identify items. 

Install this mod after any other mods you plan to install, so that items added by those mods will have their Lore values adjusted as well.
